# oh-my-agent

## Architecture

- **SSOT**: `.agents/` directory (do not modify directly)
- **Response language**: Follows `language` in `.agents/oma-config.yaml`
- **Skills**: `.agents/skills/` (domain specialists)
- **Workflows**: `.agents/workflows/` (multi-step orchestration)
- **Subagents**: Same-vendor native dispatch via Claude Code Agent tool with `.claude/agents/{name}.md`; cross-vendor fallback via `oma agent:spawn`

## Per-Agent Dispatch

1. Resolve `target_vendor_for_agent` from `.agents/oma-config.yaml`.
2. If `target_vendor_for_agent === current_runtime_vendor`, use the runtime's native subagent path.
3. If vendors differ, or native subagents are unavailable, use `oma agent:spawn` for that agent only.

## Code Search

Prefer **serena MCP** tools over native find/grep when locating code — they are symbol-aware and faster on large repos. Fall back to native Read / Glob / Grep only when serena is unavailable or for plain file content reads.

| Task | Preferred tool |
|------|----------------|
| Locate a symbol definition (class / function / variable) | `find_symbol` |
| Find references / callers of a symbol | `find_referencing_symbols` |
| Outline a file's top-level symbols | `get_symbols_overview` |
| Pattern or regex search across the codebase | `search_for_pattern` |
| Find a file by name | `find_file` |
| List directory contents | `list_dir` |

## Workflows

Execute by naming the workflow in your prompt. Keywords are auto-detected via hooks.

| Workflow | File | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| orchestrate | `orchestrate.md` | Parallel subagents + Review Loop |
| work | `work.md` | Step-by-step with remediation loop |
| ultrawork | `ultrawork.md` | 5-Phase Gate Loop (12 reviews) |
| ralph | `ralph.md` | Persistent loop wrapping ultrawork with an independent judge |
| plan | `plan.md` | PM task breakdown |
| brainstorm | `brainstorm.md` | Design-first ideation |
| architecture | `architecture.md` | Architecture diagnosis, comparison, ADR |
| design | `design.md` | Design system + DESIGN.md with anti-pattern enforcement |
| review | `review.md` | QA audit |
| debug | `debug.md` | Root cause + minimal fix |
| deepsec | `deepsec.md` | Drive `oma-deepsec` end-to-end (setup / scan / pr-review / matchers / triage / config / troubleshoot) |
| scm | `scm.md` | SCM + Git operations + Conventional Commits |
| docs | `docs.md` | Documentation drift verify + sync |
| recap | `recap.md` | Daily / period AI conversation recap |
| deepinit | `deepinit.md` | Project harness init (AGENTS.md / ARCHITECTURE.md / docs/) |
| convert | `convert.md` | File format conversion by category: documents→Markdown (oma-pdf/oma-hwp), image/video/audio transcode (ffmpeg) |
| video | `video.md` | Brief → script → assets → render-spec → Remotion (oma-video) |
| schedule | `schedule.md` | Register & manage time-based agent jobs via `oma schedule:*` |

(`tools` and `stack-set` are slash-invoked utilities, `schedule` is a slash-invoked workflow (`oma schedule:*` time-based jobs), and `convert` is slash-invoked to avoid false positives on "convert this code" phrasing; all are intentionally excluded from keyword detection.)

To execute: read and follow `.agents/workflows/{name}.md` step by step.

## Auto-Detection

Hooks: `UserPromptSubmit` (keyword detection), `PreToolUse`, `Stop` (persistent mode)
Keywords defined in `.agents/hooks/core/triggers.json` (multi-language).
Persistent workflows (orchestrate, ultrawork, work, ralph) block termination until complete.
Deactivate: say "workflow done".

## Rules

1. **Do not modify `.agents/` files** (SSOT protection).
2. Workflows execute via keyword detection or explicit naming, never self-initiated.
3. Response language follows `.agents/oma-config.yaml`

## Project Rules

Read the relevant file from `.agents/rules/` when working on matching code.

| Rule | File | Scope |
|------|------|-------|
| backend | `.agents/rules/backend.md` | on request |
| commit | `.agents/rules/commit.md` | on request |
| database | `.agents/rules/database.md` | **/*.{sql,prisma} |
| debug | `.agents/rules/debug.md` | on request |
| design | `.agents/rules/design.md` | on request |
| dev-workflow | `.agents/rules/dev-workflow.md` | on request |
| frontend | `.agents/rules/frontend.md` | **/*.{tsx,jsx,css,scss} |
| i18n-arb | `.agents/rules/i18n-arb.md` | **/*.arb |
| i18n-guide | `.agents/rules/i18n-guide.md` | always |
| infrastructure | `.agents/rules/infrastructure.md` | **/*.{tf,tfvars,hcl} |
| market | `.agents/rules/market.md` | on request |
| mobile | `.agents/rules/mobile.md` | **/*.{dart,swift,kt} |
| quality | `.agents/rules/quality.md` | on request |

## Install Mode

oma supports project-mode (`<cwd>/.agents/`) and global-mode (`~/.agents/`).
When touching install/update/uninstall code, read `web/docs/guide/global-install.md`.

## Source Repo: Additional Rules

> This section applies only to the oh-my-agent source repository itself.

- `.agents/` modifications are allowed (this IS the source repo)
- `bun run test` runs CLI tests (vitest).
- `bun run lint` runs the linter.
- `bun run build` builds the CLI.
- `bun run typecheck` type-checks CLI and web. **Run it before every commit**: vitest (esbuild), biome, and `bun build` all skip tsc, so type errors otherwise surface only at the pre-push hook and reject the push late.
- **When manually exercising the CLI, always run the LOCAL code**: `bun cli/cli.ts <args>` (source) or `node cli/bin/cli.js <args>` (fresh build after `bun run build`). Never use `bun run oma` or bare `oma` — the repo root has no workspace bin link, so both silently fall back to the globally installed (likely stale) oma on PATH, and you end up debugging against the wrong version.
- commitlint: conventional commits required (build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test)
- Commit Co-Author: `First Fluke <our.first.fluke@gmail.com>`
